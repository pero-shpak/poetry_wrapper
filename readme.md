# Poetry Install Wrapper :rocket:

Welcome to **Poetry Install Wrapper** ‚Äî your ultimate tool for managing Python projects with Poetry, but with a twist!  :performing_arts: 
This script wraps around Poetry, adding some extra magic to make your life easier (and a bit more fun). :sparkles:

---

## What Does It Do? ü§î

This script is like a Swiss Army knife for Python projects using Poetry. It helps you:

1. **Automagically install Poetry** if it's not already installed.  
   (Because who has time to read installation docs? :sweat_smile:)

2. **Configure Poetry** to create virtual environments inside your project folder.  
   (No more hunting for `.venv` in obscure directories!)

3. **Add custom commands** to Poetry:
   - `poetry create`: Creates a new project with a virtual environment.  
   - `poetry clear`: Cleans up your project by removing the virtual environment and related files.  
   (Think of it as a "reset button" for your project. :broom:)

4. **Generate a `pyproject.toml`** with sensible defaults.  
   (Because starting from scratch is overrated.)

5. **Create a `.gitignore`** file to keep your virtual environment out of Git.  
   (Because nobody wants to commit their `.venv` by accident. :see_no_evil:)

Who said managing Python projects has to be boring?

Pro Tips :bulb:
If you're feeling adventurous, customize the pyproject.toml after it's generated.

Use poetry clear responsibly. It's like a "delete" button ‚Äî there's no undo! :warning:

If something breaks, just blame the script. It won't mind. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
